            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
                </li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).
                </li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript.</li>

            <p>
                JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.
            </p>

            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways: </p>
            <p>
                With the keyword var. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                var x = 42.
            </code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
            </p>
            <p>
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                x = 42.
            </code>
            <p>
                This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the keyword let. For example,
            </p>
            <code>
                let y = 13.
            </code>
            <p>
                This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
            </p>

            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function,
                    it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example
                    the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within
                    which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                </code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
                <code>
                    if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                    not defined
                </code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
